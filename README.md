## Design System

**Background**: Pure white (`#ffffff`) across all pages for consistency

**Color Palette**: Unified warm cream system

- **Surface hierarchy**: `surface-container-lowest` → `surface-container-highest` (white to subtle cream tones)
  - `surface-container-lowest`: `#ffffff` (pure white)
  - `surface-container-low`: `#fefdfb`
  - `surface-container`: `#fdfaf7`
  - `surface-container-high`: `#faf6f2`
  - `surface-container-highest`: `#f7f2ed`
- **Primary**: Warm peach (`#ffb085`) with dark variant (`#c67b5c`)
- **Mobile accent**: Golden amber (`#c48a28`) for FAB and active states
- **Text**: `on-surface` (`#4a3b32`), `secondary` (`#6b5a4d`)
- **Glassmorphism**: 4 variants — `glass-card`, `glass-elevated`, `glass-panel`, `glass-panel-social`

**Typography**:

- Display: Outfit (landing pages)
- Body: Manrope (app UI)
- Mono: JetBrains Mono (measurements, code)

**Shadows**: 4-level elevation system (`shadow-elevation-1` through `shadow-elevation-4`)

**Border Radius**: `radius-sm` (6px) → `radius-xl` (24px)

**Known Hardcoded Values** (to be refactored):

- Social components use hardcoded Tailwind colors (`bg-orange-100`, `text-rose-500`, etc.)
- Pattern SVG fills in `SocialSplitPane.tsx` use hex values
- Background orbs in `SocialLayout.tsx` use hardcoded opacity values

## Product Tiers

## Getting Started

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Configure `.env.local` with your AWS Cognito, S3, and Stripe credentials. Set `AWS_SECRET_NAME=skip` for local development (secrets loaded from `.env.local` instead of Secrets Manager).

## Architecture

All computational logic lives in pure `src/lib/*-engine.ts` files with zero DOM dependencies, fully testable in Vitest. Hooks bridge engines to Fabric.js canvas. Components handle UI.

**Auth flow:** Cognito sign-in sets HTTP-only cookies (`qc_id_token`, `qc_access_token`, `qc_refresh_token`). `proxy.ts` verifies JWT via JWKS for protected routes. `getSession()` does DB lookup for role. Rate limiting on all auth endpoints.

**Security:** SVG sanitization (DOMPurify), CSP headers, open-redirect prevention, webhook signature verification, admin role gating, S3 credential validation.

**Route protection:**

- `/studio/*` — server layout redirects guests to `/auth/signin?callbackUrl=...`
- `/profile/*` — proxy redirect
- `/admin/*` — cookie + role check (`admin` role only)
- `/dashboard` — public, but protected actions trigger `AuthGateModal`

**Pro gating:** Check `useAuthStore.isPro` client-side before opening pro dialogs. API routes check `session.user.role` and return 403 `PRO_REQUIRED`.

## Database Schema

18 tables across 20 schema files, 10 enums. Key tables: `users` (with `user_status` enum), `userProfiles`, `projects`, `projectTemplates`, `blocks`, `fabrics` (with Shopify fields: `isPurchasable`, `shopifyProductId`, `shopifyVariantId`, `pricePerYard`, `inStock`), `user_fabrics`, `patternTemplates`, `socialPosts`, `comments`, `likes`, `savedPosts`, `notifications`, `printlists`, `subscriptions`, `blogPosts`

## Mobile

Studio is desktop-only (`StudioGate` redirects mobile users). Mobile shell: Home, Upload FAB (center), Profile/Sign In — 3 items only. No social browsing or project gallery on mobile.

## Brand Voice

Warm, quilter-friendly, conversational — like a knowledgeable friend in a quilt shop. Address quilters directly ("you"/"your"). Use quilting vocabulary naturally (seam allowance, yardage, WOF, fat quarter). Lead with what the quilter gets, not what the software does. Headlines: 2–6 words, punchy, wordplay welcome. **Avoid**: "professional-grade", "comprehensive suite", "cutting-edge", "leverage", "utilize", "enterprise", "robust" — any generic SaaS language.
